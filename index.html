  <h2>The Mission of Scouting</h2>
  <p>
    To contribute to the education of young people, through a value system based on the Scout Promise and Law, 
    to help build a better world where people are self-fulfilled as individuals and play a constructive role in society.
  </p>

  <h3>The Scout Promise</h3>
  <blockquote>
    On my honour I promise that I will do my best<br>
    To do my duty to God and the Republic of Singapore<br>
    To help other people and<br>
    To keep the Scout Law
  </blockquote>

  <h3>The Scout Law</h3>
  <ul class="scout-law">
    <li>A Scout is to be trusted</li>
    <li>A Scout is loyal</li>
    <li>A Scout makes friends, establishes and maintains harmonious relations</li>
    <li>A Scout is disciplined and considerate</li>
    <li>A Scout has courage in all difficulties</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>The Scout Motto</h3>
  <p><strong>"Be Prepared"</strong></p>
  <p class="quote">
    ‚ÄúBe Prepared... the meaning of the motto is that a scout must prepare himself by previous thinking out 
    and practicing how to act on any accident or emergency so that he is never taken by surprise.‚Äù<br>
    - <em>Lord Baden-Powell</em>
  </p>

        <section class="page" id="page1">
            <h2>The Scout Movement</h2>
            <p>
                The Scouting Movement began in 1907 when Lieutenant General Robert Baden-Powell organized the first
                experimental camp on Brownsea Island, England. The camp, which hosted 20 boys from diverse social
                backgrounds, tested ideas that would later be published in his seminal book, <em>Scouting for Boys</em>.
                This publication laid the foundation for a worldwide youth movement that emphasized outdoor activities,
                moral values, leadership, and self-reliance.
            </p>

            <p>
                The core principles of Scouting are encapsulated in the Scout Promise and Law, which promote duty to
                God, loyalty to one's country, helping others, and personal integrity. The movement is non-political and
                open to all, regardless of race or creed. It fosters holistic development through learning-by-doing,
                leadership opportunities, service projects, and nature-based experiences.
            </p>

            <h3>Growth and Global Reach</h3>
            <p>
                From its British roots, Scouting spread rapidly across the British Empire and beyond. By 1920, the first
                World Scout Jamboree was held in London, gathering over 8,000 Scouts from around the globe. The World
                Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM) was formed in 1922 to coordinate international efforts. As of
                today, Scouting boasts over 50 million members across more than 170 countries.
            </p>

            <h3>Objectives of the Scout Movement</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Develop physical, intellectual, emotional, social, and spiritual potential.</li>
                <li>Foster teamwork and leadership through patrol-based systems.</li>
                <li>Promote environmental stewardship and sustainability.</li>
                <li>Instill a lifelong commitment to service and citizenship.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Singapore Scouting</h3>
            <p>
                Scouting arrived in Singapore in 1910, just three years after the movement began. It was introduced by
                Frank Cooper Sands and began with the establishment of the first Scout troop at Raffles Institution.
                Known as the ‚ÄúFather of Scouting in Singapore,‚Äù Sands laid the groundwork for what would become a vital
                national institution. Today, the Singapore Scout Association operates under the Ministry of Education
                and the World Scout Movement, offering programs for Cub Scouts, Scouts, Venture Scouts, and Rover
                Scouts.

            <h2>Troop Hierarchy & Activities</h2>

            <h3>üü• National-Level Structure (Singapore Scout Association)</h3>
            <p>
                The Singapore Scout Association (SSA) is structured to deliver both national strategy and grassroots
                execution. It includes formal leadership roles, councils, commissioners, and operational units.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Chief Scout:</strong> The President of Singapore serves as the ceremonial head and grants
                    warrants and major awards to adult leaders and commissioners.</li>
                <li><strong>Scout Council:</strong> Composed of both uniformed and lay officials, this council provides
                    strategic direction and financial oversight for the entire Association.</li>
                <li><strong>Commissioners' Council:</strong> Develops and enforces operational policies, training
                    standards, and programmatic direction across all scouting sections.</li>
                <li><strong>Headquarters Staff:</strong> A professional administrative team that supports logistics,
                    finance, records, and day-to-day operations.</li>
                <li><strong>Leadership Academy:</strong> The national center for leadership development, responsible for
                    designing and delivering structured training to leaders and adult volunteers.</li>
                <li><strong>Chief Commissioner:</strong> The highest-ranking uniformed officer overseeing all aspects of
                    SSA operations.</li>
                <li><strong>Deputy and Assistant Chief Commissioners:</strong> Each responsible for a key portfolio such
                    as youth program, training, or administration.</li>
                <li><strong>National Training Commissioner:</strong> Oversees all adult training programs and ensures
                    compliance with global standards.</li>
                <li><strong>National Programme Commissioner:</strong> Designs and manages the youth progression and
                    badge frameworks.</li>
                <li><strong>International/Relations Commissioner:</strong> Manages relationships with other National
                    Scout Organizations, WOSM, and oversees international exchanges and jamborees.</li>

                    activities within their assigned regions (areas and districts).</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                These leadership levels ensure that national goals align with grassroots delivery and that policies are
                properly implemented across all groups.
            </p>

            <h3>üü¶ Unit-Level Structure (Troop & Patrol System)</h3>
            <p>
                At the unit (e.g., troop) level, leadership is youth-centered, guided by trained adult leaders. The
                system is based on empowering Scouts to lead and work collaboratively through patrols.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Group Scout Leader (GSL):</strong> The overall adult leader who oversees the entire scout
                    group (which may include Cubs, Scouts, Ventures, and Rovers).</li>

                    and Scout welfare.</li>
                <li><strong>Senior Patrol Leaders (SPLs):</strong> Experienced youth leaders who coordinate activities
                    across different patrols, often mentor newer Scouts.</li>
                <li><strong>Patrol Leaders (PLs):</strong> Lead a group of 6-8 Scouts (a patrol), delegate tasks, and
                    ensure everyone participates in activities.</li>
                <li><strong>Assistant Patrol Leaders (APLs):</strong> Support the PL and assume leadership when the PL
                    is absent or needs help.</li>
                <li><strong>Quartermaster:</strong> Responsible for maintaining, organizing, and issuing the troop's
                    camping and activity equipment.</li>
                <li><strong>Secretary:</strong> Keeps meeting minutes, attendance, and troop documentation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>üü® Key Leadership Functions</h3>

                    testing, and Scout welfare.</li>

            <h2>Types of Knots</h2>

            <p>
                Knot tying is a vital Scouting skill, taught from the earliest levels and practiced regularly in
                activities like camping, pioneering, boating, and rescue work. Mastery of knots not only promotes safety
                but also critical thinking and manual dexterity.
            </p>

            <h3>Basic Knots</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Square Knot (Reef Knot):</strong> For joining two ropes of equal thickness. Used in first
                    aid for tying bandages.</li>
                <li><strong>Clove Hitch:</strong> Used to start and end lashings. Simple to tie but can slip under load
                    if not secured properly.</li>
                <li><strong>Bowline:</strong> Creates a fixed loop that won't tighten or slip. Ideal for rescue
                    scenarios and securing gear.</li>
                <li><strong>Figure Eight Knot:</strong> A basic stopper knot. Prevents the rope from passing through a
                    pulley or hole.</li>
                <li><strong>Sheet Bend:</strong> Connects two ropes of different diameters. Reliable and secure.</li>
                <li><strong>Taut-Line Hitch:</strong> An adjustable knot for tent guy-lines or securing loads that may
                    shift.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Pioneering-Specific Knots</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Timber Hitch:</strong> Starts a diagonal lashing or secures logs temporarily.</li>
                <li><strong>Round Turn and Two Half Hitches:</strong> For tying a rope to a pole or ring under tension.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Sheepshank:</strong> Shortens a rope or bypasses a damaged section without cutting it.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Lashings</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Square Lashing:</strong> Joins two poles at a right angle, such as for a frame or table.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Diagonal Lashing:</strong> Secures crossing poles under strain.</li>
                <li><strong>Shear Lashing:</strong> Binds two poles side-by-side or forms a hinge.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Scouts often compete in knot-tying relays and are expected to demonstrate both speed and accuracy in
                their technique.
            </p>

        <section class="page" id="page4">
            <h2>Types of Badges & Awards</h2>

            <p>
                Badges in Scouting are designed to recognize personal achievement, skill mastery, community involvement,
                and leadership. They serve as a visual record of a Scout's journey and accomplishments. Badges fall into
                three major categories: Proficiency, Progress, and Special Awards.
            </p>

            <h3>1. Proficiency (Skill) Badges</h3>
            <p>
                These badges certify a Scout's competence in specific skills. Scouts must complete a series of practical
                tasks or projects to earn each badge.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>First Aid Badge:</strong> Treating injuries, CPR, emergency preparedness.</li>
                <li><strong>Camping Badge:</strong> Setting up tents, fire safety, wilderness survival.</li>
                <li><strong>Cooking Badge:</strong> Preparing balanced meals outdoors, kitchen hygiene, and safety.</li>
                <li><strong>Swimming Badge:</strong> Water safety, stroke proficiency, and lifesaving techniques.</li>
                <li><strong>Photography Badge:</strong> Understanding composition, lighting, and editing.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Badge:</strong> Advocating for conservation, completing eco-projects.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Progress Awards (Singapore)</h3>
            <p>
                Scouts in Singapore work toward structured awards reflecting their development in Scouting, leadership,
                and service.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bronze Progress Award:</strong> Introductory skills, including knot tying and first aid
                    basics.</li>
                <li><strong>Silver Progress Award:</strong> More advanced outdoor and leadership skills.</li>
                <li><strong>Gold Progress Award:</strong> Requires community service, project planning, and strong troop
                    involvement.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Special Awards</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>President's Scout Award:</strong> The highest award for Scouts in Singapore. Requires years
                    of consistent excellence, leadership, and a final assessment.</li>
                <li><strong>Chief Commissioner's Award:</strong> Given to those who demonstrate exceptional initiative
                    and service.</li>
                <li><strong>National Service Badges:</strong> Recognize acts of public service or national celebration
                    involvement.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Earning these badges not only develops a wide skillset but also boosts self-confidence, pride, and a
                sense of belonging.
